First time:
There are 93149 log entries in the log file!!!
It takes my log analyzer 7358 ms to count all the events in the log file after running 1 tests

Second: 5567 ms

***
optimize the output contents so that it is exactly the same as that generated by Monpoly:
There are 93149 log entries in the log file!!!
It took my log analyzer 4989 ms to count all the log entries in the log file in the format of plain txt

-----------------------
rvm as backend:
21556 ms to get exactly the same output as hard-coding and Monpoly

=======================
Use RVM, no monitoring, just invoke the methods on every insert event and incr the num of invocations:

There are 93149 log entries in the log file!!!
There are 9218173 insert events
It took my log analyzer 17359 ms to count all the log entries in the log file in the format of plain txt

So 4 seconds for monitoring, and 12 seconds for invoking all the methods

=======================
It took Monpoly (opt) 36 seconds to output all violations of insert2DB2 Property in the 300MB log file!
output 101MB
