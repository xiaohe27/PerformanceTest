Using mapped byte buffer with byte array (bulk read)

In the test with buf size 1 KB, the avg time used is 3628
In the test with buf size 2 KB, the avg time used is 2723
In the test with buf size 4 KB, the avg time used is 2725
In the test with buf size 8 KB, the avg time used is 2715
In the test with buf size 16 KB, the avg time used is 2717

In the test with buf size 32 KB, the avg time used is 2644

In the test with buf size 64 KB, the avg time used is 2694
In the test with buf size 128 KB, the avg time used is 2716
In the test with buf size 256 KB, the avg time used is 2728
In the test with buf size 512 KB, the avg time used is 2705

Using direct byte buffer:

In the test with buf size 1 KB, the avg time used is 3206
In the test with buf size 2 KB, the avg time used is 3132
In the test with buf size 4 KB, the avg time used is 3119
In the test with buf size 8 KB, the avg time used is 3133
In the test with buf size 16 KB, the avg time used is 3103

In the test with buf size 32 KB, the avg time used is 3074

In the test with buf size 64 KB, the avg time used is 3077
In the test with buf size 128 KB, the avg time used is 3081
In the test with buf size 256 KB, the avg time used is 3081
In the test with buf size 512 KB, the avg time used is 3093

Using mapped byte buffer is about 15% faster than using byte buffer with allocateDirect method.
