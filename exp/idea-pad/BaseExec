It took Monpoly 34 seconds to scan all the log entries in the 9M log file by using 
an always pass formula (check insert)!


=========================================================================================
Start time : 1420978301
There are 93149 log entries in the log file!~!
It took my log analyzer 36865 ms to count all the insert events in the log file.

Finish time : 1420978338

It took my log analyzer 37 seconds to count all the events in the 9M log ldcc4Monpoly at Idea-Pad using an all-can-pass formula

===
If using the approach of reading line by line (no regex is used and therefore
cannot detect ill-formed log entries):

It took my log analyzer 30 seconds to count all the events in the 9M log ldcc4Monpoly at Idea-Pad

After adding the regex for tuple, it becomes:
32 seconds

6.25% faster than Monpoly's opt.

removing LogEntry Object, just parse each basic element

My LogAnalyzer's
Un-checked fast version:  one time faster than Monpoly's opt

RegEx version: 17% faster than Monpoly's opt
