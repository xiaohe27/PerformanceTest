It took Monpoly 34 seconds to scan all the log entries in the 9M log file by using 
an always pass formula (check insert)!


=========================================================================================
Start time : 1420978301
There are 93149 log entries in the log file!~!
It took my log analyzer 36865 ms to count all the insert events in the log file.

Finish time : 1420978338

It took my log analyzer 37 seconds to count all the events in the 9M log ldcc4Monpoly at Idea-Pad using an all-can-pass formula

===
If using the approach of reading line by line (no regex is used and therefore
cannot detect ill-formed log entries):

It took my log analyzer 30 seconds to count all the events in the 9M log ldcc4Monpoly at Idea-Pad

After adding the regex for tuple, it becomes:
32 seconds

6.25% faster than Monpoly's opt.


=============*******************========================
removing LogEntry Object, just parse each basic element

Start time : 1421157832
There are 93149 log entries in the log file!~!
It took my log analyzer 16915 ms to count all the log entries in the log file.

Finish time : 1421157849

It took my log analyzer 17 seconds to count all the events in the 9M log ldcc4Monpoly at Idea-Pad using reading line by line approach

If Using Regex to parse each tuple, it becomes:
29 seconds

If reading byte by byte, then even if doing all the security checks and ensures the grammar is exactly the same as Monpoly
it only took 5.2 seconds to parse all the 93149 log entries, which is 
6.5 times as fast as Monpoly, 5.5 times faster than Monpoly


My LogAnalyzer's
Un-checked fast version (read char stream via buffered reader):
one time faster than Monpoly's opt

RegEx version: 17% faster than Monpoly's opt
